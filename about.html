                    For as long as I can remember, I’ve always been fascinated by two things: geography and technology. My interest in geography began when my parents handed me down a now vintage GeoSafari world globe, which included an interactive game, for my 7th birthday. I remember spending so much time learning different facts about the countries of the world that my parents had to buy new batteries for the globe multiple times.

                    Beyond this, my interest in geography continued as I grew older. As I continued to develop my Excel knowledge throughout high school and college, I began taking up analyzing geographic data as a hobby simply because I found it fascinating and a way to help me better understand the world around me. This included a range of things from analyzing population densities to visualizing “hospital deserts”. I familiarized myself with free-to-use programs like qGIS for mapping data and even learned that Excel of all things has some limited mapping functionalities to assist with my independent research.

                <p>
                    My passion and skills in the field of GIS grows by the day, and my goal is to one day combine that passion and my previous work experience to have a career as a GIS Developer.
